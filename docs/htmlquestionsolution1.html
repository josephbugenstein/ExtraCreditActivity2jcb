        <h2>Geographic Inquiry:Thinking Geographically</h2>
        <p>Geography is the study of the world and all that is in it: its peoples, its land, air, and water, its plant and animals, and all the connections among its various parts. When you are investigating the world and its events you are dealing with geography. As you move through space in your everyday life you are observing and interacting with geography and making geographic decisions based on those encounters. You may not be aware of it but you are involve in <strong>geographic inquiry.</strong> This mode of thinking is not unlike other research oriented approaches, such as the scientific method; however, it has one big difference: space. Knowing where something is, how its location influences its characteristics, and how its location influences relationships with oth3er phenomena are the foundation of geograhic thinking. This mode of investigation asks you to see the world and all that is in it in spatial terms. Like other research methods, it also asks you to explore, analyze, and act upon the things you find. It also is important to recognize that this is the same method used by professionals around the world working to address social, economic, political, environmental, and a range of scientific issues. They, like you, have  geography and GIS as key organizers.</p>

        <p>Think about a topic or place, and identify something interesting about it. Spin that observation in the form of a question, such as <em>"Why do these particular trees show sign of stress?" or "How does do the types of businesses change as we move along the street?" or "What does it matter if that whole area is cleared of trees?"</em>
